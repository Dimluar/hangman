WELCOME TO HANGMAN!
__________________________________________________________________

In this console version of the classic game you will have to try to guess the random word in seven tries.

In every turn or round you can decide to guess a letter of a word.

Apart from guessing you can use the commands:
 - !quit: closes game.
 - !save: save game locally.

If you decided to guess a letter you will get it's position on the word or it will be added to your mistakes.

You can write already mistaken letter so be careful!

If you try to guess a word know that when failing no letters will be revealed and you will use a opportunity like normal.

Every time you fail you will have opportunities left with drawings, losing when the last leg is drawn.

When starting a new game you can decide between starting form scratch or load a previously saved game.
